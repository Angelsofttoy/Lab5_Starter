+ 1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.

A: Yes, because this is a specific part of the function/part of the entire code, which testing a specific functionality is what the unit test is about. 

+ 2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.

A: In this case no, because interactions between component is something that could not be tested through uni test.
